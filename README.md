# Full Stack MERN Application

This is the first Full Stack application I am making, I am in the process of intrigrating my [Todo Application](https://github.com/AngusWebbHammond/todo-list) in this application.
This has plenty of issues currently, but is slowly getting to a working condition.

Currently the Front and Back end both are locally hosted, I do aim to host these online in the future once I have verification and authentication added.
